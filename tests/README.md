## Testing Frameworks & Tools

### Primary Testing Stack
- **Vitest**: Modern test runner with TypeScript support

  - ✅ Login → Dashboard → Alert Investigation
  - ✅ Workflow phase progression (Detection → Scoping → Investigation → Remediation)
  - ✅ Containment actions (isolate endpoints, disable accounts)
  - ✅ MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
  - ✅ Log analysis and forensic data review

- **Manager Role Workflow**
  - ✅ Business impact metrics visibility
  - ✅ High-level incident status oversight
  - ✅ Report generation capabilities
  - ✅ Resource allocation decisions

- **Client Role Workflow**
  - ✅ Simplified incident communication
  - ✅ Status update requests
  - ✅ Business-appropriate information filtering

#### Cross-Role Features
- **AI Assistant Integration**
  - ✅ Role-appropriate guidance and suggestions
  - ✅ Context-aware recommendations
  - ✅ Incident-specific assistance

### 3. Type Safety Tests

#### Custom TypeScript Validation (`tests/type-safety.test.ts`)
Prevents specific production errors:
- ✅ WorkflowSession type conversion errors (use-workflow.tsx:73)
- ✅ Index signature errors (dashboard.tsx:96,98)
- ✅ Drizzle ORM type mismatches (storage.ts:311)
- ✅ Date/string conversion issues

#### Runtime Type Checking
- ✅ API response validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Playbook node access safety
- ✅ Workflow state type guards

        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Test Environment Setup (`tests/setup.ts`)
- JSView and browser API mocking
- MSW server initialization
- Custom matcher configuration

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow the existing file structure
2. Use descriptive test names and group related tests
3. Mock external dependencies appropriately
4. Include both happy path and error scenarios
5. Test accessibility and user experience

### Test Data Guidelines
- Use realistic cybersecurity scenarios
- Include proper MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings
- Ensure test data covers edge cases
- Maintain consistency with production data schemas

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Coverage reporting requires additional configuration
- Some component imports need path resolution fixes
- Puppeteer tests require Chrome installation in CI environments

### Future Improvements
- Add visual regression testing
- Implement E2E testing with Playwright
- Add performance testing for large datasets
- Expand accessibility testing coverage
- Add internationalization testing
