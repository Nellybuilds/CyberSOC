  Based on the test results, here are the failed tests:

  Summary

  - Total Tests: 147 tests
  - Failed: 75 tests
  - Passed: 72 tests
  - Files: 10 failed test files, 2 passed

  Major Failing Categories

  1. WorkflowTracker Component Tests

  Issue: Import/Export errors - component not properly exported
  - Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined
  - Location: tests/unit/WorkflowTracker.test.tsx:31, 38, 46
  - Cause: Missing or incorrect component export from WorkflowTracker component

  2. Dashboard State Management Tests

  Issue: Mock data not loading correctly
  - Test: "logs dashboard state for debugging"
  - Expected: Dashboard to have activeAlert "alert-1" and criticalAlerts array with data
  - Actual: activeAlert is undefined, criticalAlerts is empty array []
  - Cause: Mock Service Worker (MSW) handlers not properly providing test data

  3. Type Safety Validation Errors

  Issue: Zod schema validation failures for WorkflowSession
  - Missing Required Fields:
    - started_at (string)
    - completed_nodes (array)
    - actions_taken (array)
    - status (enum: 'Active' | 'Completed' | 'Paused')
    - user_role (enum: 'Analyst' | 'Manager' | 'Client')

  4. Data Loading Issues

  Issue: Test components showing empty data states
  - Endpoints count: 0 (expected > 0)
  - Logs count: 0 (expected > 0)
  - Missing alert data in test scenarios

  Root Causes

  1. Component Export Issues: WorkflowTracker component export/import mismatch
  2. Mock Data Configuration: MSW handlers not properly configured for test scenarios
  3. Schema Validation: WorkflowSession objects missing required properties
  4. Test Setup: Mock data not being loaded correctly in test environment

  Recommended Fixes

  1. Fix WorkflowTracker component export in client/src/components/WorkflowTracker.tsx
  2. Update MSW handlers in tests/mocks/handlers.ts to provide complete test data
  3. Ensure WorkflowSession test objects include all required Zod schema fields
  4. Verify test setup properly initializes mock data before component rendering

  The type safety tests are mostly passing (showing that the core type system works), but the component and integration tests are failing due to missing mock
  data and import issues.
