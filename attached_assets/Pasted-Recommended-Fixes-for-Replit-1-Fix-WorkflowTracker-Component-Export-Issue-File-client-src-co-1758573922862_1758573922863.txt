Recommended Fixes for Replit

  1. Fix WorkflowTracker Component Export Issue

  File: client/src/components/WorkflowTracker.tsx
  Problem: Component export/import causing "Element type is invalid" errors
  Fix: Ensure the component is properly exported as default export:
  // At the end of WorkflowTracker.tsx, ensure:
  export default WorkflowTracker

  2. Fix Dashboard Data Loading Issues

  File: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
  Problem: Dashboard state showing activeAlert: undefined, criticalAlerts: []
  Fix: Ensure the Dashboard component properly handles API data loading and sets initial state correctly when alerts are fetched.

  3. Fix MSW Handler Endpoints

  File: tests/mocks/handlers.ts
  Problem: Mock Service Worker handlers not matching actual API endpoints
  Fix: Ensure MSW handlers match the exact API endpoints used by the application:
  - /api/alerts should return mock alert data
  - /api/endpoints should return mock endpoint data
  - /api/logs should return mock log data
  - Handlers should provide complete data objects with all required fields

  4. Fix Component Import Paths

  Problem: Tests cannot find components they're trying to import
  Fix: Verify and correct import paths in test files, particularly:
  - WorkflowTracker component import in tests/unit/WorkflowTracker.test.tsx
  - Dashboard component imports
  - Ensure all component files exist at expected paths

  5. Fix Schema Validation Data

  Problem: Zod validation failures for WorkflowSession objects
  Fix: Ensure all WorkflowSession objects in application code include required fields:
  - started_at (string)
  - completed_nodes (array)
  - actions_taken (array)
  - status (enum: 'Active' | 'Completed' | 'Paused')
  - user_role (enum: 'Analyst' | 'Manager' | 'Client')

  Key Principle

  DO NOT modify the test files - fix the application code that the tests are validating. The tests are correctly identifying real issues in the
  application.

  Priority Order

  1. WorkflowTracker export (blocking multiple tests)
  2. Dashboard data loading (core functionality)
  3. MSW handlers (test infrastructure)
  4. Schema validation (data integrity)
  5. Import paths (test execution)

  These fixes should address the root causes of the 75 failing tests by fixing the actual application code issues rather than masking them in
  the tests.
