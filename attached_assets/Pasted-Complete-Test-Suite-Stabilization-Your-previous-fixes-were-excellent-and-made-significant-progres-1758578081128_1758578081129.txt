Complete Test Suite Stabilization

  Your previous fixes were excellent and made significant progress! You successfully resolved the major structural issues. Now we need to address the remaining compilation errors and data
  loading issues to complete the test suite stabilization.

  Priority 1: Fix Test File Compilation Errors (Critical)

  File: tests/integration/incident-response-workflow.test.ts:210
  Error: Expected ">" but found "/"
  Fix: Correct JSX syntax error in the render statement. Likely missing import or incorrect JSX closing tag.

  File: tests/integration/role-based-access.test.ts:58Error: Expected ">" but found "client"
  Fix: Fix JSX syntax in QueryClientProvider component - likely missing import or malformed JSX.

  Files: tests/type-safety.test.ts and tests/workflow-integration.test.ts
  Error: "No test suite found in file"
  Fix: Ensure these files export proper Vitest test suites with describe() blocks or convert them to be properly recognized by Vitest.

  Priority 2: Complete Dashboard Data Loading Fix

  File: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx or related MSW handlers
  Issue: Dashboard state still showing activeAlert: undefined, criticalAlerts: []
  Fix: Ensure MSW handlers in test environment properly provide mock alert data that matches the API endpoints the Dashboard component is calling.

  Priority 3: Address Remaining Component Import Issues

  Components: AIAssistantPanel, Login, ReportGenerator
  Issue: Various component rendering and import failures
  Fix: Verify component exports and imports are correct, ensure all required props are provided in tests.

  Key Guidelines:

  1. Fix application code, not test code - Continue the successful approach you used before
  2. Focus on compilation errors first - These prevent tests from even running
  3. Ensure MSW handlers match real API endpoints - The mock data should align with what the components expect
  4. Maintain the structural improvements you already made - Don't regress the WorkflowTracker fixes

  Expected Outcome:

  Target: Reduce from current 61 failed tests to under 30 failed tests by fixing the compilation errors and data loading issues.

  Please continue the excellent work fixing the actual application code rather than modifying test expectations!
