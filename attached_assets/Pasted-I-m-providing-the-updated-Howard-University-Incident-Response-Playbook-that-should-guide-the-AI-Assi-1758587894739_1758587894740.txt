I'm providing the updated Howard University Incident Response Playbook that should guide the AI Assistant functionality in my CyberSOC application. This playbook
   defines:

  1. **AI Guidance Features** (Section 6): Step-by-step branching logic, Sentinel/Defender telemetry-based popups, and playbook citations
  2. **Role-Specific Views** (Section 5): Technical details for Analysts, SLA status for Managers, plain-language for Clients
  3. **Interactive Workflow** (Section 7): Clickable actions like "Isolate Endpoint", "Review Logs", "Escalate Case"
  4. **Incident Response Lifecycle** (Section 4): The 6-phase process that should drive workflow progression

  Please update the application to implement:
  - AI Assistant Panel with branching logic from this playbook
  - Proper workflow progression through the 6 phases (Preparation â†’ Lessons Learned)
  - Interactive containment actions (Isolate Endpoints, Lock User Accounts, etc.)
  - Role-based content filtering as defined in Section 5

  The current codebase has the foundation but needs the AI Assistant Panel enhanced to follow this playbook structure and provide the guided experience described.

  Focus on implementing the missing Phase 1 features rather than fixing test mocks.

  ðŸ”‘ Key Benefits of This Approach

  1. Gives Replit Clear Direction: Instead of guessing what the AI Assistant should do, it now has the actual playbook
  2. Aligns with Your Vision: This matches your original prompt's emphasis on "AI-guided workflow" and "interactive containment actions"
  3. Provides Real Content: The playbook gives actual prompts, steps, and branching logic to implement
  4. Focuses on Value: Directs attention to user-facing features rather than test infrastructure

  ðŸ’¡ What This Should Enable

  With this playbook, Replit should be able to implement:
  - âœ… AI prompts like "Outbound traffic anomaly detected. MITRE ref: TA0011. Start guided response?"
  - âœ… Branching workflows through the 6-phase incident response lifecycle
  - âœ… Role-specific filtering so Managers see SLA status while Analysts see technical details
  - âœ… Interactive actions that actually progress the simulation state
  - âœ… MITRE ATT&CK integration with proper technique mapping
